        Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science-fiction sitcom
        created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network&apos;s
        nighttime programming block Adult Swim. It is distributed
        internationally by Warner Bros. Television Distribution. The series
        follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and
        his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time
        between domestic life and interdimensional adventures that take place
        across an infinite number of realities, often traveling to other planets
        and dimensions through portals and on Rick&apos;s flying saucer. The
        general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting scenarios:
        domestic family drama, and an alcoholic grandfather dragging his
        grandson into hijinks.
